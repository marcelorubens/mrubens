          <p>Yep, I also made this entirely from scratch.</p>
          <p>
            Started with some rough ideas and early sketches for what would become a project for my own portfolio: itself.<br>
            It needed to be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Visually clean and extremely readable and straightforward.</li>
            <li>Dynamic - so I could add as many entries I wanted.</li>
            <li>Responsive for all screen sizes.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
